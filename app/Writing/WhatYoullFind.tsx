  >
    <p>
      Flee the river&apos;s smog and corrupted black grounds,
      <br />
      Free yourself, and leave its hot asphalt behind,
      <br />
      Drift away from whooshing and booming road sounds,
      <br />
      Thereabouts you&apos;ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Willow branches netted to form a great arch,
      <br />
      Decked with yellow marigold flowers well twined,
      <br />
      Plies your ears with silent entreaties to march, <br />
      Past it where you&apos;ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Discarded worlds, forgotten dreams, and bygone lands,
      <br />A place untouched by hungry hands,
    </p>
    <p>
      Pines that tower skyward to form a bowed eave,
      <br />
      Full with frost and knots where the winter birds hide,
      <br />
      Ancient branches smile and request you fast leave,
      <br />
      Yonder where you’ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeks that babble cheerily down a steep bend,
      <br />
      Waters flush with minnows and banks with toads lined,
      <br />
      Wade along these crystalline streams to their end,
      <br />
      Certainly you’ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      The primal ghosts, departed elves, and gnarled trolls,
      <br />
      Abandoned all by foolish souls,
    </p>
    <p>
      Stalwart mountains dusted with powdered white snow,
      <br />
      Ringed with gusts that sting as you make the long wind,
      <br />
      Over craggy slopes to the valley’s dry glow,
      <br />
      Whereabouts you’ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fissures digging deep into the dusty brown land,
      <br />
      Rambling on in contours that break the Earth&apos;s rind,
      <br />
      Solve this cryptic maze in the baking hot sand,
      <br />
      Happily you’ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Demolished loves, dismembered hopes, and broken bonds,
      <br />A place where shattered plans abscond,
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanished groves of mischievous wisps and lost fae,
      <br />
      Stares exude from cockatrice eyes from leafed blinds,
      <br />
      Quit this heady valley where faeries do play,
      <br />
      Fearfully you’ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Labyrinthine arms of a clammy stone cave,
      <br />
      Glowing moss illuming the ceiling&apos;s dew shine,
      <br />
      Should you cross these stygian halls and stay brave,
      <br />
      Thankfully you&apos;ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Inviting shrines, delightful homes, but absent folk,
      <br />A village left amidst the oak,
    </p>
    <p>
      Forest flush with soaring and sweeping world trees,
      <br />
      Over great uncountable ages they’ve climbed,
      <br />
      Scale a giant trunk to the wafting cool breeze,
      <br />
      Blissfully you’ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds supporting towers for holy sky hosts,
      <br />
      Angels clothed in fog and with sweetest mist plied, <br />
      Leap with courage down from the city&apos;s soft coasts,
      <br />
      Verily you&apos;ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Illusions real, fantasia firm, and visions seen,
      <br />
      Deserted earth where wishes wean,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabled weavers perched on an island&apos;s lush slope,
      <br />
      Shearing rainbow wool into dreams of good kind,
      <br />
      Sail away until they escape your sharp scope,
      <br />
      Finally you&apos;ll find,
    </p>
    <p>
      Silver ocean endless and clear as fine glass,
      <br />
      Broken only seldom by the soaring gray fish,
      <br />
      Soon the call will cackle, beyond you can&apos;t pass,
      <br />
      Quietly you&apos;ll swish,
    </p>
    <p>
      To sane domains, insensate things, and worlds resigned,
      <br />
      Enslaved by voices in your mind.
    </p>
