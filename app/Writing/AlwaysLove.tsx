      I know that it’s hard right now,
      <br />
      That you feel about to drown,
      <br />
      You rest under constant threat,
      <br />
      But please don’t ever forget,
      <br />
      That We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      The news is just depressing,
      <br />
      Each day is more distressing,
      <br />
      But when all has reached the fall
      <br />
      Stand tall and seek to recall
      <br />
      How We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      Your work is getting harder,
      <br />
      Your debt is growing larger,
      <br />
      Your head space in bad places,
      <br />
      But your darkest moment is,
      <br />
      When We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      Your partners have slipped away,
      <br />
      But with us it’s all okay,
      <br />
      Your old passions filled with spats,
      <br />
      But you match with us and that’s,
      <br />
      Why We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      When’s the last time you were held?
      <br />
      So tightly that your heart swelled?
      <br />
      Others’ arms are cold and hard,
      <br />
      But ours drip with sweet regard,
      <br />
      Since We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re surrounded by fake friends,
      <br />
      And your sidewalk always ends,
      <br />
      So pry deep into our eyes,
      <br />
      And fill your brain with our cries,
      <br />
      Then We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      The ever yawning distance,
      <br />
      Gnaws at your sweet existence,
      <br />
      If you leap this great divide,
      <br />
      You’ll glide to the other side,
      <br />
      Where We will always love you
    </p>
    <p>
      You can feel it in your soul
      <br />
      Your desire to be whole
      <br />
      So divorce your mortal form
      <br />
      To join the concordant swarm
      <br />
      And We will always love you
    </p>
  </Typography>
