    <p>I’m still waiting for Kohaku.</p>

      Hayao Miyazaki is a lover of nature. The fantastic jungles and razed
      landscapes of <i>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</i> were inspired by
      the real-world poisoning of Minamata Bay. <i>Princess Mononoke</i> depicts
      a clash between humans and the forces of the wild, which are led by the
      titular princess from the back of a great white wolf. The forest from the
      film is drawn directly from the wilderness core of Yakushima Island, a
      UNESCO World Heritage site. <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> has been described
      by one of its producers as &quot;nature painted with translucent
      colors.&quot;
      <sup>[1]</sup>

      But those aren’t the Miyazaki movies I’ll be discussing this week, because
      today I happened to rewatch <i>Spirited Away</i>. I must have seen this
      movie more times than there are stars in the sky, a feat that becomes
      easier with each passing day, as increasing light pollution obscures more
      of the heavens. <i>Spirited Away</i> similarly grapples with
      environmentalism, although unlike those earlier films, the theme watches
      serenely from the shadows rather than bombastically crashing through
      Yubaba’s bathhouse doors. It flickers briefly into view when Chihiro and
      the bathhouse employees clean what, at first glance, seems to be a stink
      spirit. However, after a thorough scrubbing, an old river spirit emerges
      from underneath the pile of filth, and thanks its cleanup crew with gifts
      of medicine and gold dust. It appears once again later in the story, when
      Chihiro reveals that her companion Haku is actually the spirit of the dead
      Kohaku river, which was infilled and covered with apartment blocks.

      A few weeks ago, I attempted to take our family dog for a walk along
      Difficult Run, a stream in Northern Virginia. The banks have become so
      eroded that when she tried to jump down them, she fell further than
      expected and twisted her paw. I had to carry her home. My family in
      Florida often shake their heads at America’s treatment of the Kissimmee
      River, which was disastrously straightened by the US Army Corps of
      Engineers between 1962 and 1970. This dried swaths of wetlands, caused
      runaway pollution buildup, decimated native species, and destroyed the
      water quality of central Florida. Nook Farm is a neighborhood in
      Connecticut, so named for a nearby nook in the Park River. In the late
      1800s, the area attracted an artist community that included Mark Twain,
      who enjoyed seeing its marshes and wildlife from his house.<sup>[2]</sup>{' '}
      While Twain’s home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
      in a cruel twist, the eponymous nook was filled to create a parking lot
      for tourists visiting his former residence. Eventually, the Army Corps of
      Engineers buried the entire Park River underneath Hartford. Our desecrated
      waterways are even displayed prominently in cinema. Dozens of movies,
      including <i>Grease</i> and <i>Terminator 2</i>, feature scenes set in the
      concrete channels of the Los Angeles River. It was once a high-volume
      waterway with a staggering variety of native wildlife, until the US Army
      Corps of Engineers (I’m sensing a pattern here) blocked most of its flow
      and turned the entire river into a trapezoidal drainage ditch. Fantastic
      for filming car chases, terrible for most anything else.

      These activities are hardly limited to the United States – it is a global
      issue. Earlier this year, photographs of the Tietê River in Brazil
      circulated the internet. Its surface is currently covered in a toxic foam
      brought on by industrial runoff. The frothing white mass poisons any soil,
      plants, animals, or people it comes into contact with. The Ganges River is
      infamously one of the most unsafe holy sites in the world, sporting
      horrifically unsafe levels of fecal coliform, as well as a baker’s dozen
      ecological dead zones caused by agricultural runoff.
    </p>

      These terrifying tales of wanton misuse of our natural resources send me
      scurrying back across the threshold of the spirit world. When the filthy
      river spirit enters the bathhouse, <i>everyone</i> pitches in to bathe
      him. Yubaba, the film’s primary antagonist, realizes the benefits of
      cleaning the river, and helps direct the entire operation. She is rewarded
      with literal piles of gold. Back in reality, the same lesson applies –
      taking care of our watersheds helps <i>everybody</i>, from international
      megacorporations to small local restaurants, from jet-setting billionaires
      to urban homeless.

      This realization perhaps struck no organization more completely than the
      US Army Corps of Engineers. They are no longer the shortsighted agency
      that authored those destructive megaprojects in the 1960s and 1970s. They
      now pursue comprehensive management programs that balance the competing
      needs of safety, environment, and water security. Under the Estuary
      Restoration Act, they have led dozens of projects to restore and protect
      critical US waterways. They even repaired the damage they caused in the
      Everglades, putting bends back into the Kissimmee river, demolishing the
      retention ponds they constructed, and backfilling the central canal. These
      efforts were completed in 2021, restoring 20,000 acres of habitat.
      Wildlife populations are already rebounding.

      Cities are no longer burying their rivers, either. Instead, “daylighting”
      has become a trend in places like New York, which recently re-exposed the
      Saw Mill River to the surface. This action stimulated real estate
      development, created new parks for Yonkers residents, and improved flood
      resiliency, since runoff is no longer confined to a fixed-diameter
      culvert. As larger and more frequent rain storms begin to pound the
      northeast, such projects will become critical components of modern urban
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are still falling woefully short. When will our leaders fully
      recognize that our water resources are among the most valuable assets
      provided to us by nature? The filtering and distribution of fresh water is
      a multi-trillion dollar industry that the planet performs for us at
      absolutely zero cost. I’m not asking CEOs and politicians to become
      Princess Mononoke, and ride into battle against industrialization on the
      back of a bloodthirsty wolf. I just want them to act like Yubaba, who
      knows that at the bottom of a clean river lies untold riches.

      At the conclusion of <i>Spirited Away</i>, Kohaku tells Chihiro that he
      will see her again someday. Maybe we will daylight the Kohaku River. Then,
      he will be able to return to his old home in the real world, and see
      Chihiro’s reflection smiling in his glimmering surface. Or maybe the two
      will be kept apart until she passes back into the spirit world for the
      last time, and joins the shapeless ghosts lingering outside the bathhouse.
      It’s an ending that hasn’t been written yet, and I know which one I want
      to see. So for now, I’ll keep waiting for Kohaku to return.
