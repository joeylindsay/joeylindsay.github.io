    <p>
      High above the Earth in a strengthened steel home,
      <br />
      Live four astronauts floating free with green souls,
      <br />
      Their abode illuming unblemished void-dark.
      <br />
      To a hatch they apply a swift and sharp pull.
      <br />
      Winking stars shed tears for the sweeping long fall,
      <br />
      These celestials soon will take through hell-flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nozzles vomit pressurized jets of cold flames,
      <br />
      Pushing off from the doughty outer space home.
      <br />
      Palmers clasp their buckles before the swift fall,
      <br />
      Sows vexation inside their weightless warm souls.
      <br />
      Cruising slowly into the waiting Earth&apos;s pull,
      <br />
      They wave fondest farewells towards the wide dark
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunlight slips beyond the horizon&apos;s veiled dark,
      <br />
      As their vessel becomes adorned with pink flames,
      <br />
      Earth begins to tighten her cruelly strong pull,
      <br />
      As she drags the unwilling travelers back home.
      <br />
      Claws of sharpest gravity tear their soft souls, <br />
      As loose objects begin to trace a slow fall
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire licks their ship as ablative shards fall,
      <br />
      To be gnawed by the starving jaws of thick dark.
      <br />
      Weight begins to stack on their fragile poor souls,
      <br />
      As pink streamers transform to boiling red flames,
      <br />
      Flashing lights paint visions above their coarse home,
      <br />
      As they yield to their worldâ€™s resistless firm pull
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag secures the craft with a wrenching long pull,
      <br />
      Its winds tear at their ship along its quick fall,
      <br />
      Slowing down the drop from their faraway home.
      <br />
      The blaze dissipates into glistening black dark,
      <br />
      Borne unharmed through jaws of surrounding hot flames,
      <br />
      They voice prayers for their heavy planet-bound souls
    </p>
    <p>
      Out their clenched jaws fly their transparent thin souls,
      <br />
      Wrenched aloft once the yoke receives a slight pull
      <br />
      Raising up their craft, still aglow from fierce flames,
      <br />
      From its plunge to a safely guided, smooth fall.
      <br />
      Lights conduct them safely through Hades&apos; pitch dark,
      <br />
      And a thud from their wheels completes their trip home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trapped without their souls at their frigid land-fall,
      <br />
      Locked by gravity&apos;s pull below a vast dark,
      <br />
      Airborne flames streak over their unrecalled home.
    </p>
