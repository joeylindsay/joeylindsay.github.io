    <p>
      I want to sip the thick green sludge,
      <br />
      And frolic in the blowing dust,
      <br />
      To breathe the toxic atmosphere,
      <br />
      And eat the withered husks of plants,
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to climb decayed tree trunks,
      <br />
      And swim in the acidic seas,
      <br />
      To scale the mountains’ topless shells,
      <br />
      And dig in soil sapped and drained
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to stroll on wasted shores,
      <br />
      And stroke the jagged rusty steel,
      <br />
      To sleep under the starless sky,
      <br />
      And smell the acrid ozone air
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to sail on deadend wind,
      <br />
      And chart the tangled landfill maze,
      <br />
      To ransack crumbling vacant homes,
      <br />
      And ride across the barren fields
    </p>
    <p>
      I want adventures wild and free,
      <br />
      And travels in the great unknown,
      <br />
      To emulate our ancestors,
      <br />
      And drink of all life’s mysteries
    </p>
    <p>
      I want their vibrant blue green earth,
      <br />
      And fish, and birds, and leaves, and fae,
      <br />
      To covet their lost wealth absurd,
      <br />
      And envy squandered gifts inane,
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to live just as they did,
      <br />
      And celebrate our common home,
      <br />
      To hold my broken planet tight,
      <br />
      And love my world as they loved theirs
    </p>
