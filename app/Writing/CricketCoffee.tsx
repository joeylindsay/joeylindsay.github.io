      A cricket&apos;s in my coffee,
      <br />
      He jumped inside to drown,
      <br />
      He&apos;s waiting at the bottom,
      <br />
      For me to gulp him down,
    </p>
    <p>
      I sip the bitter liquid,
      <br />
      He slips between my lips,
      <br />
      I spit before I swallow,
      <br />
      And out my mouth he drips!
    </p>
