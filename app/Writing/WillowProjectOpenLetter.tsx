    <p>Dear President Biden,</p>
    <p>
      I would like to personally commend you on your firm position with respect
      to the Willow Project. Throughout these past weeks, you have demonstrated
      a dedication to the US oil industry that few, including myself, saw in you
      on election day. I’d like to specifically applaud some of your strongest
      and most inspiring stances on this contentious issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after receiving information from the Bureau of Land Management that
      the operation will release 316 million tons of carbon dioxide at a rate of
      10,600 tons per year<sup>[1]</sup>, you stayed the course. Yes, you
      originally planned on achieving net-zero emissions by 2050,<sup>[2]</sup>{' '}
      but what’s an extra few years here or there? The planet has plenty of time
      – it’s not like 17 people have died in California floods<sup>[3]</sup> or
      13 in New York<sup>[4]</sup> or over 80 in Florida.<sup>[5]</sup> Climate
      change can wait, there’s money to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the economics of this deal are perhaps where you stood the
      tallest. According to ConocoPhillips, the project is set to increase state
      and federal revenue by a maximum of 17 billion dollars.<sup>[6]</sup> The
      fact that the project will cost a minimum of 19.8 billion dollars in
      damages did not deter you.<sup>[7]</sup> Neither did reports from the
      Bureau of Land Management, which indicate that total revenue would
      actually be closer to 8 billion dollars.<sup>[8]</sup> If a 9 billion
      dollar loss is what it takes to potentially convince a corporation to
      funnel a much smaller amount of money into rural Alaskan communities, then
      it’s surely a worthwhile investment. It’s obviously unimportant that,
      according to its own statistics, ConocoPhillips gave just 52.9 million
      dollars in contributions in 2021, or less than 1% of its yearly profits.
      <sup>[9]</sup> No, we need this oil, and we need it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is why it was so brave of you to stand by Willow, even once you were
      aware that oil wouldn’t start flowing from the reserve for over six years.
      <sup>[8]</sup> It was quite discerning of you to plan ahead for the future
      of fossil fuels, even when the project will do nothing to immediately
      lower gas prices. Your persistence was similarly admirable. Since the
      6,430 drilling permits you already approved,<sup>[10]</sup> including 26
      to ConocoPhillips in Alaska,<sup>[11]</sup> didn’t impact prices, the
      6,431<sup>st</sup> will make all the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been further impressed by your unique ability to rise above
      irrelevant criticism. When American Indian activists traveled thousands of
      miles to protest Willow in front of the White House,<sup>[12]</sup> you
      wisely ignored their quibbling. Local residents clearly have no insight
      into regional issues, and the federal government should unilaterally
      determine how the land surrounding their homes is utilized. You also
      looked past the extraneous 3.25 million (at time of writing) signatures
      attached to a petition to block the project.<sup>[13]</sup> You sir, are a
      man who sees the important issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a doubt, the most sincere threat facing your administration is
      Rean finger pointing. When right–wing analysts blamed you for rising gas
      prices,<sup>[14]</sup> you heroically demonstrated your sincere desire to
      cow to their jeers and appease them. Even though their critiques are
      blatantly unfounded,<sup>[15]</sup> you know that government policy is at
      its best when it addresses fears raised by liars. With the approval of the
      Willow Project, Reans will stop accusing you and retract all their
      previous statements. It’s not as if they’re your opponents in the upcoming
      election, with a vested interest in making you appear unsympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning that election, the Willow Project will absolutely improve your
      poll numbers. Environmental degradation is currently the third most
      important issue among Democrats, behind only Healthcare and the Economy,
      and trailing the latter by just 1%.<sup>[16]</sup> It’s plain to see that
      voters will wholeheartedly support your decision to coat the Alaskan
      wilderness in a sheet of black carbon, destroy over 500 acres of bird
      habitat, degrade the air quality of Nuiqsut (the nearest town), bulldoze
      critical caribou rangeland, cripple the townspeople’s food supply, and
      melt Arctic permafrost.<sup>[1][17][18]</sup> I know that I will
      personally keep all of these facts in mind while casting my ballot.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Biden, I am humbled by your resolve. You clearly have the
      interests of the young people who overwhelmingly voted for you
      <sup>[19]</sup> at heart. In 30 years, the Willow Project will have run
      its course, and I’ll walk through acid rain to board a train to work, just
      like I do today. As that locomotive is rolling down the tracks, I’ll look
      out the window at the rich oil executive driving his Porsche on the
      highway next to me. When I do, I’ll thank God that the Biden
      administration made him a few million richer and his gas a couple cents
      cheaper. Your action on this matter will be remembered for generations to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours,
      <br /> Joey Lindsay, a concerned and very sarcastic citizen
