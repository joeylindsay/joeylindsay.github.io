    <p>Dear President Biden,</p>
    <p>
      Three days ago, on July 27th, 2023, ocean temperatures off coastal Florida
      reached 101°F. The aquatic heat wave has roasted coral alive in their
      skeletons, scorched the scales off of small fish, and boiled native
      seagrass into paste. If you dipped a ladle into the waters around the
      Florida Keys this week, you would come up with a salty seafood stew.
    </p>
    <p>But you probably already knew all that.</p>
    <p>
      Presumably, you also know that this has been one of the hottest weeks on
      record. Temperatures skyrocketed into the triple digits across the United
      States. Forget about frying an egg on the sidewalk. With the amount of
      heat that asphalt absorbs, you could have placed a chicken breast on the
      street and cooked it clean-through.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also unlikely to be surprised by the fact that this oppressive
      atmosphere has been accompanied by raging thunderstorms. The
      app-formerly-known-as-twitter was plastered with posts showing the
      scattered debris created by just one of these tempests. I broke a Capital
      Bikeshare by accidentally riding over a rock that was displaced by the
      storm. It flew up into the frame of the bicycle, disabling the locking
      mechanism, and almost ricocheted into a car driving down the road next to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are already aware of all the impacts this week has wrought upon on the
      planet and its people. Of the lost livelihoods of Florida fishers. Of the
      tens of millions of dollars in storm damages. Of the hundreds of Americans
      who have died of dehydration and heat exhaustion. You have almost
      certainly seen the branches ripped off of the trees on your own South
      Lawn. None of this is news to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would hardly be the first person to compare humanity’s current
      predicament to the famous “Boiling Frog” experiments conducted by German
      psychiatrist Friedrich Goltz in the 19th century. The story goes that a
      frog placed in a pot of water will remain there and boil to death, as long
      as the temperature is raised slowly enough. The parallels to climate
      change are readily apparent, as the very air we breathe incrementally
      warms around us, and we do nothing to stop it. The anecdote has been
      referenced in this context by marine biologist Daniel Pauly, author Daniel
      Quinn, and politician Al Gore, among countless others.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the most crucial component of these experiments is often omitted
      in modern retellings: Goltz extracted the brains of these frogs before
      boiling them. His tests also demonstrated that if the frog’s brain was
      left intact, it would leave the warming water without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Biden, are we brainless frogs? Will we continue to treat our home as a
      trash pit until we sink underneath the weight of our own carbon refuse?
      Electrifying the federal fleet is not good enough – it is not even clear
      that electric cars are greener than their fossil-fuel burning
      counterparts. Your oil projects alone fly in the face of the promises you
      made to the American people about protecting their homes, businesses, and
      natural spaces. In the time it took you to read this letter, one more
      irreplaceable species has gone extinct. I implore you to live up to your
      word and take immediate, strong action on climate change. Otherwise, your
      children will live in a poorer, hotter, and more desolate America. A
      nation in which all the coral has been bleached into dust, and all the
      frogs have been boiled alive, brains and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours,
      <br /> Joey Lindsay
