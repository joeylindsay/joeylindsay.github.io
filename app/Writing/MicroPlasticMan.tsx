    <p>
      Miniscule but tough as nails,
      <br />
      Strong as steel, he never fails,
      <br />
      Punctures snails and strangles whales,
      <br />
      The Magnificent Micro-Plastic Man!
    </p>
    <p>
      In our hearts and in our blood,
      <br />
      Washing up in massive floods,
      <br />
      Everywhere and thick as mud,
      <br />
      The Omnipresent Micro-Plastic Man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Break him down, he only grows,
      <br />
      Multiplies to beat his foes,
      <br />
      He can&apos;t even decompose,
      <br />
      The Indestructible Micro-Plastic Man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown or green or white or blue,
      <br />
      Camouflaged in every hue,
      <br />
      Hidden from your prying view,
      <br />
      The Invisible Micro-Plastic Man!
    </p>
    <p>
      How to stop him, no one knows,
      <br />
      Tougher than the greatest blows,
      <br />
      We&apos;re too feeble to oppose,
      <br />
      The Invincible Micro-Plastic Man!
    </p>
