    <p>
      I still feel swaddled in your body heat,
      <br />
      Each time I close my weary eyes in sleep,
      <br />
      And when the morningâ€™s hypnogaugy creeps,
      <br />
      The apparitions tuck you in my sheets
    </p>
    <p>
      With every burning sip your visage treats,
      <br />
      The blurry corners of my wasted sight,
      <br />
      With every puff your steps once more alight,
      <br />
      Beside my own along the empty streets
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These sweetest visions grace me every day,
      <br />
      Prescribed to me by my miswired mind,
      <br />
      I often pray they never fade away,
      <br />
      Because I&apos;d die if you left me behind,
      <br />
      I&apos;m just one more disgrace who&apos;s fallen prey,
      <br />
      To having a fictitious girl enshrined
    </p>
