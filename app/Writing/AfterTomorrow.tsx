      Our cable died one blustry summer night,
      <br />
      We called up Cox and got a bot,
      <br />
      It said they’d help us when time was right,
      <br />
      Till then our network would be shot,
      <br />
      The weeks rolled by and they did not appear
      <br />
      We thought they’d fix it long ago,
      <br />
      We asked the robot when they’d make it here,
      <br />
      It said, sometime after tomorrow
    </p>
    <p>
      I met a man who drove a belching car,
      <br />
      It spewed out clouds of dirty smoke,
      <br />
      He said he wouldn&apos;t drive it very far,
      <br />
      I knew he lied just when he spoke,
      <br />
      For thirty thousand miles he rode it on,
      <br />
      Its toxic fumes still free to blow,
      <br />
      I begged him to stop driving it along,
      <br />
      He said, sometime after tomorrow
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady dressed in pure white teeth told me,
      <br />
      She&apos;d let me give a ring to her,
      <br />
      But not until she&apos;d roamed and been so free
      <br />
      The years flew past in rapid whir,
      <br />
      I called to ask if she was now prepared,
      <br />
      She told me that she did not know,
      <br />
      I wondered when we would at last be paired,
      <br />
      She said, sometime after tomorrow
    </p>
    <p>
      The politicians ramble on and on,
      <br />
      They claim to have a lofty plan,
      <br />
      To grow the world that we all live upon,
      <br />
      But when we ask if they&apos;ve began,
      <br />
      They always have excuses right on hand,
      <br />
      They tell us that the work is slow,
      <br />
      We plead for them to take a stronger stand,
      <br />
      They say, sometime after tomorrow
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends and I have constant aims to meet,
      <br />
      But never seem to follow through,
      <br />
      We make designs to hike and drink and eat,
      <br />
      Then flake before we ever do,
      <br />
      We tried to see a show this prior week,
      <br />
      But though we wanted all to go,
      <br />
      We each invented an excuse unique,
      <br />
      We said, sometime after tomorrow
    </p>
    <p>
      I vowed that I would work to feel more proud,
      <br />
      Of these short days I call my own,
      <br />
      But every time I try I start to doubt,
      <br />
      And only feel much more alone,
      <br />
      I swore I&apos;d learn to love this life of mine,
      <br />
      But when it&apos;s time for me to grow,
      <br />
      I feel no joy and waste my precious time,
      <br />I say, sometime after tomorrow
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I lived within that hallowed age,
      <br />
      When all the doing has been done,
      <br />
      I won’t live long enough to turn the page,
      <br />
      My bones will bleach ere we’ve begun,
      <br />
      But I’ll still dream of all those halcyon days,
      <br />
      When we’re released from all our woe,
      <br />
      A time of problems solved and mended ways,
      <br />
      Sometime in the endless after tomorrow
    </p>
